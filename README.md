PostScript Tiny Ray Tracer

This repo contains the original PostScript tiny ray tracer by Takashi Hayakawa, which won 1st prize in the PostScript obfuscation contest in 1993.

32 years later, I've decided to analyze and improve Hayakawa's obfuscation and minimization techniques.

This repo contains code supporting my [article](https://seriot.ch/projects/postscript_tiny_ray_tracer.html). Expanded versions end with an underscore.
