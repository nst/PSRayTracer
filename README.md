# PSRayTracer

This repo contains the original PostScript tiny ray tracer by Takashi Hayakawa, which won 1st prize in the [PostScript obfuscation contest](https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/contrib/postscript/obfuscated-1993/) in 1993.

32 years later, I've decided to analyze and improve Hayakawa's obfuscation and minimization techniques.

This repo contains code supporting my [article](https://seriot.ch/projects/postscript_tiny_ray_tracer.html). Expanded versions end with an underscore.
